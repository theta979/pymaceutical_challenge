# pymaceutical_challenge
Week Five Challenge using Python and Jupyter NoteBook 

Bringing together what we've learned about Pandas dataframes and PyPlot we plot the finding in a pharmaceutical trial in search of promising drugs to shrink tumors in mice. We used techniques such as cleaning and merging data, summariing data in dataframe tables and plotting the results in various forms.

Formulas for processing data were also used such as the pearson regession and linear regression to visualize correlations in study data
